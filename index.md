**Stoned 0.1**  is a pop-up online exhibition curated by Metaleptic and the Miracle Collective. It will be available from December 31st 2020 to April 1st 2021 as work in progress.

**Stoned** is a conceptual framework to work on the intersection between mind and matter, rocks and psychic activity. Altered states of consciousness involve the human senses in different ways. For a time, the law of noncontradiction might cease to reign over liquids, air, solids and minds. Fossils and DNA both represent the same form of ancestry going back too far, much further than the type of relation we are intuitively able to understand. Stones are said to have psychic powers. Stones are revered as gods in certain areas of the world. Stoned, the kids in the dark of the park say they are, from friday evenings to sunday mornings. In this exhibition, stones are used as metaphors for ideas. Eerie visions, animated ideas and curious encounters bring together the works of all the participants who all share a certain fascination for stones, rocks, geology and archaeology, paleontology and prehistory. 

**[Metaleptic](www.metaleptic.com)** is a recursion-oriented MMO game engine and learning platform imagined by Benjamin Efrati in 2020. Hijacking the classic video game studio model, it is inspired by projects such as Processing, Garryâ€™s Mod, Code.org, Minecraft and Manyland. Metaleptic enables the player to play and fork its original games via a gamified UI/UX, but goes further by enabling users to create projects from scratch using a web-based IDE and customizable visual tools . Designed to foster cooperative workflows, the platform connects games via different protocols such as combination, remixing and nesting. These principles aim at empowering users and fostering new gameplay patterns.

Exhibiting artists:

Mario AMEHOU, Joan AYRTON, Benjamin EFRATI, GNoZo, Julie GOERGEN, Wassim HALAL, Shu ISAKA, Carin KLONOWSKI, Zsuzsana KREIF, Walter LANGELAAR, Katalin LOVRITY, Taichi MORIYAMA, Fuyumi MURATA, Nao NISHIHARA, Thomas PERINO, Aoi TAGAMI, Philipp TEISTER, Balazs TURAI, Yann VAN DER CRUYSSEN
